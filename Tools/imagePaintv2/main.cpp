Built with Qt 5.1 and mingw32 compiler, this project was undertaken to ease the marking of images before haar training. The program
lets user select the image folder and mark each images using a rubber band. The top left coordinate and width and height of the selection
can be saved in text file with format that is compatible with opencv's haar training tool.
